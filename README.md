### Space based object detection optimisation with neuromorphic cameras

The aim of this expriment was to track what effects manipulating the biases of a neuromorphic camera had on object detection in an adverse lighting simulation set up to replicate a star cluster in the night sky. 

The set up placed a neuromorphic camera on a GRBL controlled carrige driven by stepper motors and was then programmed to sweep over a simulated star field in a "Dark Room" 

The starfield was made using fibre optic strands to replicate stars. This allowed for multiple strands to be grouped together in order to offer various sizes and illumination strengths. The fibres were feed into a thick predrilled plywood in order to support a good portion of the end to make sure light was perpendicular to the top face of the board.
